# List

The most common collection in nearly every programming language is the array or ordered group of objects [1] [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/). 



7. **List** can hold a collection of variables inside it, and these variables should be the same type. In the movie app, we will need two lists. One will hold the names of our movies, and the other one is for image paths inside the **assets** folder. Right now, we will create a list of movies that holds the names of the movies; later we will create the other list for the images. Replace `// TODO: #2 Create movies list ` with 

```dart
 List movies = [
    'Toy Story',
    'Spider Man',
    'Inside out',
    'The LEGO Movie',
    'The Lion King',
    'Frozen',
    'Shrek',
    'BIG HERO',
    'ICE AGE',
    'BRAVE',
  ];
```

> Here, we created a list variable that holds the names of our movies, and the type of these names is **String**. So, the **movies** List variable will only hold a String type variable.

> **Note:** the List starts from zero, where 0 is the index of the first value. If you want to access the second value you will increase the index by one.
